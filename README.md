# Introduction

Rasa Controller is a framework for building chatbot:

## Features ##

- Intents
- Followup Intents
- Clarification Triggers
- Simple and single Training JSON file
- Easy to configure and deploy

## Integration ##

- Slack bot

### Why am I building this ? ###

> - I worked on a project with [Rasa Core](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core) library. It is a powerful but requries a lot of extra efforts on top of it's built in features like domain file, story file etc.
> - My goal is to prepare a simple framework that can fulfil all expectation of a chatbot developer.
> - I will add a control panel in future to monitor and configure training data and health of the bot.
